# Flag to start and end program
start = True
filename = 'guest_book.txt'
name = ''
print("Type 'stop' when done.")

# open/create filename and open it in append mode since we will write in it multiple times
with open(filename, 'a') as file_object:

    while start:
            name = input('Please enter you name: ')
            if name == 'stop':
                start = False
            else:
                print('Welcome ' + name + ' !!')
                file_object.write(name + ' has just input their name.sdfdsfs\n')
