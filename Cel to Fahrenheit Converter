# Write a program which prompts the user for a Celsius temperature, convert the temperature to
# Fahrenheit, and print out the converted temperature.

CelIn = input("Please enter Celsius temperature: ")
Faren = 32 + (int(CelIn) * (9/5))

print(Faren)

# Improve by making a GUI and can do both Cel to Faren and inverse.
